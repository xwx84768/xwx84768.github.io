We propose **SysDPO**, the first Direct Preference Optimization framework for aligning compound AI systems at the system level. By modeling the system as a directed acyclic graph of components, SysDPO enables joint optimization even in the presence of non-differentiable links and missing component-level preferences. We demonstrate its effectiveness on two applications: a language-model–plus–diffusion pipeline and a multi-LLM collaboration system.
